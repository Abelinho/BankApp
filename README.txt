This is a Bank account app. It reads account data from a file, creates those accounts and saves them in memory.

Download this project and open it in your IDE.

Create a text file containing list of accounts e.g:

Abel Ikeji,112233445,savings,5000
Abah Paul,012345678,savings,3000...

and use the directory path of this file in your main method while reading the file.

Then run the application.
